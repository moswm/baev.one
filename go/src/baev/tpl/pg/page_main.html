<p>&nbsp;<br /><b>Advantages of our cooperation with you:</b>
<ul>
<li>communication directly with the developer allows you to convey tasks as accurately as possible and completely eliminate the effect of a "damaged phone";</li>
<li>I independently lead all stages of design and development of the program, so I can fully imagine the finished final product;</li>
<li>individual and thorough approach to the project, according to your wishes and requirements, unlike a company where a developer can simultaneously engage in programming of several projects as on a "conveyor line";</li>
<li>personally interested in further support and development of the program, in long-term cooperation;</li>
<li>and finally, the cost of work with the same quality of performance is significantly lower than in a company that has to bear the costs of renting a large office, paying wages, management and administrative expenses. Or, as often happens, the company is just an intermediary that receives an order from you and passes it to the developer.</li>
</ul>
